Welcome to the Ginsu

Updated: 7 Sept 2010

If you want to contribute to Ginsu development, please follow the instructions
below.

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
Download the Native Client SDK from the link here:
  http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient-sdk/wiki/HowTo_GetStarted
and unpack at any desired location <naclsdk_root>.

Set environment variable NACL_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT so the toolchain can be found by
the development environment.  It should be set to
  <naclsdk_root>/toolchain/<platform>_x86
Where <platform> is mac, linux, or win.  For example, you can set
NACL_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT for lunix development like this:
  export NACL_TOOLCHAIN_ROOT=/usr/local/myldap/toolchain/linux_x86

Also set GINSU_ROOT to the root of your Ginsu source view:
  export GINSU_ROOT=/usr/local/myldap/ginsu/trunk
(Note: the trailing 'trunk' in the pathname is important).

Ginsu depends on the following packages from NaClPorts:
  boost
  OpenSceneGraph

Install the packages Ginsu into the toolchain using a python script in the Ginsu
project:

  python <ginsu_root>/scripts/setup_naclports_packages.py

Finally, build Ginsu:

  cd <ginsu_root>
  ./hammer.sh

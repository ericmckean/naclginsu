Welcome to the Ginsu

Updated: 29 June 2010

If you want to contribute to Ginsu development, please follow the instructions below.
Ginsu development is done primarily on Linux, either 32-bit or 64-bit.

DEVLEOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
Download the Native Client SDK from
http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/nacl_archive/nacl_new_sdk/naclsdk_linux.tgz and
unpack at any desired location <naclsdk_root>.
Set environment variable NACL_SDK_BASE so the toolchain can be found by the
development environment.  It should be set to <naclsdk_root>/toolchain/linux_x86
This can be done in the command line as follows.

  export NACL_SDK_BASE=<naclsdk_root>/toolchain/linux_x86

Ginsu depends on the following packages from NaClPorts:
  boost
  OpenScegeGraph

Install the packages Ginsu into the toolchain using a python script in the Ginsu
project:

  python <ginsu_root>/scripts/setup_naclports_packages.py

Finally, build Ginsu:

  cd <ginsu_root>
  ./hammer.sh

= How To Set Up Eclipse =


These instructions show you how to set up
[http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse] to build Ginsu.

*Note:* Ginsu does not build a 64-bit version.  When running Ginsu, you must use a 32-bit browser configuration.

After following the steps below, you should have an Eclipse project that will build Ginsu and install the Ginsu Web app in `scons-out/dbg/staging/`.

== Set Up Eclipse ==

First, make sure your version of Eclipse is fairly up-to-date.  At time of writing (July 12, 2010), the latest version of Eclipse is Helios (3.6).  All of these instructions were developed on Galileo (version 3.5).  To get a copy of Eclipse, visit [http://www.eclipse.org www.eclipse.org].

<ol>
  <li>*Start a new project*.  Start Eclipse, and select File -> New -> C++ Project
    <ul>
      <li>Under Project Type, select Empty Project</li>
      <li>Click Next</li>
      <li>On the 'Select Configurations' panel, click 'Advanced...' to configure the C++ Builder</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>*Configure the C++ Builder*.  In the Properties panel that is now open, Make sure 'C/C++ Build' is selected.
    <ul>
      <li>In the 'Builder Settings' tab, *uncheck* 'Use default build command'.</li>
      <li>In the Build command text field, enter `${PWD}/hammer.sh`</li>
      <li>Click the 'Behaviour' tab.</li>
      <li>In the 'Build (incremental build)' text field, enter `--mode=dbg`</li>
      <li>In the 'Clean' text field, enter `-c`</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
    

== How to Run Ginsu ==

To run Ginsu, you will need to follow these steps (_*Note:*_ these instructions apply to Linux only.  See
[http://nativeclient-sdk.googlecode.com The Native Client SDK] for info on other platforms):

<ol>
  <li>Run a web server that can serve the contents of `scons-out/dbg/staging/`.  A simple python-based server is installed into `scons-out/dbg/staging/httpd.py`, you can run this with:
    <blockquote><code>python httpd.py 5103&</code></blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Run a *32-bit* NaCl-enabled version of the Chrome Browser. On Linux, you can use this command line:
    <blockquote><code>/opt/google/chrome/chrome --enable-nacl&</code></blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>In the browser, go to `ginsu.html`.  If you used the python-based web server from step 1, type this into the Google Chrome address bar:
    <blockquote><code>http://localhost:5103/ginsu.html</code></blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

_TODO:_ Add info on how to attach nacl-gdb to a browser process.
